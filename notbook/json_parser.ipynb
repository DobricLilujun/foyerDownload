      "The color of the sky appears to be a shade of blue because it reflects sunlight. The Earth's atmosphere scatters light in all directions, but short-wavelength visible light (blue and violet) are scattered more than others due to their shorter wavelengths. This scattering effect causes most of this light to scatter into our eyes from every direction we look at the sky during daylight hours.\n",
